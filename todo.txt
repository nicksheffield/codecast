Todo

	- Ignore .app files because it treats it like a folder
	- Ignore .asar files
	- should be able to clear broadcast folder
	- not such a bad error when you try to cast a folder that has been moved
	- Better organisation in electron.js and live-file-view.js
		- maybe refactor them both into the same structure
			- oh shit, maybe move live-file-view stuff into the renderer?
	- Two package.json structure
	- Move away from bower
