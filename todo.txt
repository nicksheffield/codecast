Todo

	- Ignore .app files because it treats it like a folder
	- Ignore .asar files
	- Add .bowerrc "directory" to live-file-view ignores
		- not sure if this is working yet
	- should be able to clear broadcast folder
	- not such a bad error when you try to cast a folder that has been moved
	- Better organisation in electron.js and live-file-view.js
		- maybe refactor them both into the same structure
	- Two package.json structure
